Subject:	QCEW Data & Analysis

Hello all,

I have finished a good chunk of the analysis, and wanted to walk through it in this email. 

Below this email, you’ll find a more detailed description of the almost-raw data files which I dropped in 
the Sharepoint, but in this email I will be describing more processed data and analysis files.

All files can be found in this folder, and I will drop a copy of this email in the folder, as a guide to the 
data: 
https://intranet.gc.cuny.edu/centers_institutes/cur/NYCLMIS/Upper%20West%20Strategies/Research/
QCEW_reports/CSA_comparison

I’ve already detected a few errors and had to re-do some things (all the files in Sharepoint are the latest 
versions), and we will of course detect more as we dig into the data.

Year, Geography, NAICS

All the files I discuss here use 2021 data, are for all the counties in the CSA’s which contain Boston, SF, 
and NYC, and use the 6-digit NAICS codes in Eileen’s Life Sciences list. I used CSA’s because they give us 
the MSA, plus a lot of surrounding counties.

Google Map

I wanted to start by sharing the latest version of my google map, as I think it could be very helpful! 

https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1QG8J6tV3qOKqwozDi02vUyuIlEbCx1Y&usp=sharing

I used the file “LifeSci_Sum_Counties.xlsx” as a base for the maps, and I will describe that file more 
below.

You can turn on or off the following layers, but you can also click on the counties and get more detailed 
information:

LifeSci Emp as % of CSA: I took the total life sciences employment in all the counties in the CSA, and 
calculated the percentage of Life Sciences employment in a given county in that CSA, which is color 
coded on the map.

LifeSci Employment (Absolute): This is just total employment in life sciences industries in that county.

LifeSci Establishments (Absolute): Number of life sciences establishments in that county.

LifeSci Ests as % of CSA: Life sciences establishments in that county, as a percent of all life sciences 
establishments in that CSA.

Core MSA Borders: This layer simply highlights the counties which are the “core” MSA (The MSA with 
Boston or SF or NYC in it).

You probably shouldn’t turn on more than one layer at once (it makes the colors weird), but you can 
turn on the Core MSA Borders, as it is just borders of counties.

“LifeSci_Sum_Counties.xlsx”

This file is a list of counties within the 3 CSA’s, with calculated columns based on the CSA or MSA the 
counties are in.

Key Variables:

lifeSci_ests: Number of life sciences establishments in county.
lifeSci_emp: Employment in life sciences industries in county.
emp_CSApct: This is employment in life sciences in that county, as a percentage of all life sciences 
employment in the whole CSA.
emp_MSApct: Employment as percentage of the MSA the county is in.

The other columns follow this pattern, with lots of geographic information, so you can filter different 
ways, and compare MSA’s within CSA’s.

“analysis_LifeSci_Sum_Counties.xlsx”

This is the above file, but I added some analysis and new sheets. There are sheets for each Hub, which 
are simply the full dataset filtered for that CSA.

NOTE: I added a sheet where I marked down the 5 boroughs of New York City. I probably need to re-do 
some of the other analyses with this as a category, but for now, you can look at the 5th sheet “NYC + 
Boroughs” and run analyses there.

“LifeSci_Sum_byIND.xlsx”

This is a longer file, which doesn’t sum all the life sciences industries, but keeps them separate.

Key Variables:

ind_ests: Establishments in that industry in that county.
ind_emp: Employment in that industry in that county.
emp_countypct: Employment in that industry in that county as a percentage of all life sciences 
employment in that county.
emp_CSApct: Employment in that industry in that county as a percentage of all life sciences employment 
in that CSA.
emp_MSApct: Same, but for the MSA.

“analysis_LifeSci_Sum_byIND.xlsx”

Same as the previous file, but with some analyses and sorting and things added by me.

This time, I added some pivot tables, which show the percentage of industry employment in the entire 
CSA as a percentage of life sciences employment in that CSA.

“LifeSci_Summary.xlsx”

This is a simpler table (no calculated columns), summarizing life sciences employment in the counties in 
a CSA. However, it also includes employment numbers from the MSA aggregates used by QCEW.

This file can be used to compare county with MSA records, and see how much data is suppressed.

“LifeSci_Summary_byInd.xlsx”

Like the previous file, this one includes the QCEW MSA aggregates, but breaks out by 6-digit life sciences 
industries.

This file can be used to compare county with MSA records, and see how much data is suppressed.

“(Wrong Years) pivot_CSA_comparison_LifeSci”

This was a pivot table analysis I was working on in Excel. However, I realized that I had made a coding 
error (this data includes Boston 2021 info, but not SF or NYC 2021 info). Also, something which is a big 
problem – I forgot to filter by just 6-digit industries, so this data double counts (adding together the 4-
digit NAICS with the underlying 6-digit).

The reason I include it is that I think these are good examples of Pivot Table analyses we can do with the 
data.

In particular, Excel has a very cool mapping feature, which you can see in the “Boston CSA Maps” sheet. 
However, it was pretty tedious to get these maps going, especially after I realized I would need to re-do 
everything after the coding error. So I decided to do most of the analysis in R, but there is a lot you can 
do in Excel!

Subject: QCEW Data

Hi all,

So in the interest of making the QCEW data more accessible, I took a large chunk of the data we need, 
added some variables, and placed them on sharepoint: 

https://intranet.gc.cuny.edu/centers_institutes/cur/NYCLMIS/Upper%20West%20Strategies/Research/
QCEW_reports/CSA_comparison

I will continue working on what we talked about (comparing life sciences employment in counties), and I 
will also work on a trimmed-down version of the data, with only columns that we need (per You’s Data 
Sources document), but I wanted to provide a large amount of the raw data in case you need to access 
it.

Files

“CSA_comparison.xlsx” – This is a big file with all industries. I wanted to provide this, so that you had 
access to as much data as possible, if you need.

“CSA_comparison_LifeSci.xlsx” – This is the same geographic areas, but filtered for just the life sciences 
industries (which were not in gray) from Eileen’s list.

Years

I decided to include the years 2017-2021 (these are annual averages, so the 2022 data is not available 
yet) because these all have the same NAICS codes.

Geography

I took a big geographic cut of the data – the CSA’s (combined statistical areas) which are made up of 
multiple Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, in order to get a range of counties around the 
hubs we are looking at.

I included two geographic units from the QCEW data: counties, and MSA’s (unfortunately, the QCEW 
CSA aggregates don’t break out by industry).

There are 4 columns in the data (AZ-BC) which allow you to compare geographic regions different ways. 
You can either look directly at the MSA industry data (the “area_fips” will start with a “C”), or you can 
look at counties within a CSA or MSA, by filtering or using a pivot table on columns AZ-BC, which have 
the codes and names for different MSA’s and CSA’s. If you wanted to compare an MSA with its 
surrounding counties, you could filter the QCEW_CSA_TITLE column for the CSA you want, and the 
QCEW_MSA column will have the different MSA’s which are within that CSA.

I think I am going to continue my analysis comparing the counties in CSA’s, MSA’s, etc. in R, but we could 
also do it using Pivot Tables in Excel.

Industries

I created the smaller file by simply filtering for the industries that Eileen put in white on her list. This is 
nice because it makes for a smaller dataset. However, I could also add a column to the larger dataset, 
marking the Life Sciences industries, so that we could filter for them on Excel, instead. I could include 
multiple columns for different definitions of life sciences (one for the industries in white, one for those 
in gray).

The QCEW presents one row for each NAICS level within an industry. If you want to analyze smaller 
industries within a NAICS, you can use columns D-G to filter and summarize industries different ways.

Next Steps

1.	If you have specific industries or counties you would like to add, I can add them into the next 
analysis.
2.	In You’s document she said we should use: “annual_avg_estabs_count, annual_avg_emplvl, 
total_annual_wages, and avg_annual_pay*” – if this is correct, I can create a version of this 
dataset with far fewer columns.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,

Sam
